# Pawfect_Match

Our project is a website that aims to accomplish the adopting out the animals who have stayed in the shelter the longest. Those who have been housed by the shelter for the longest period of time will be placed on the forefront of the website's page. Our goal is to improve visibility in pet adoption as well as learning how to create web applications..
