      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        At Pawfect Match, our mission is to bring attention to the animals who
        are too often overlooked, the ones who have waited the longest for a
        chance at a forever home. Every shelter pet deserves love, safety, and
        companionship, but many of them remain unnoticed simply because they’ve
        been there longer. Our platform is designed to challenge that pattern by
        placing these long-term residents at the forefront of the adoption
        process.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe visibility is a powerful tool. By giving priority placement
        to animals with the longest shelter stays, we hope to encourage adopters
        to consider pets they may not have noticed otherwise. These animals have
        just as much love to give, and often, even more gratitude to show.
        Through thoughtful design and purposeful organization, Pawfect Match
        aims to create a more compassionate and inclusive adoption experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project also represents our commitment to learning and applying
        real-world development skills in a way that creates impact. By
        integrating both front-end and back-end technologies, we have built a
        platform that not only works, but also works for good. Through this
        process, we have explored how design, data, and empathy can come
        together to support an important cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, Pawfect Match exists to remind people that every animal has
        a story worth hearing. We hope our platform helps bridge the gap between
        shelters and potential adopters, and that it inspires more people to
        consider giving a second chance to a pet who has been waiting just a
        little longer for theirs.

          <p>
            I co-created Pawfect Match as a way to help shine a light on shelter
            pets who are often overlooked, especially the ones who’ve been
            waiting the longest. I’ve always had a deep love for rescue animals
            and have adopted two cats from shelters. My current companions,
            Cupid and Apollo, are both rescues, just like the two cats I had
            before them. One thing that’s always stood out to me is how rarely
            people talk about adopting senior cats or long-term shelter
            residents, it’s almost always about kittens. I wanted Pawfect Match
            to change that and give every animal, no matter their age or how
            long they’ve waited, a real shot at finding a home.

          <h3>Olivia</h3>
          <p>
            I’m Olivia, and I co-created Pawfect Match with Jade to help bring
            more attention to shelter animals that are too often overlooked,
            especially those who’ve been waiting the longest. I have three
            rescue pets of my own: two dogs, Atlas and Chase, and a bunny named
            Skinny. Each of them came into my life in different ways, but
            they’ve all taught me how much love rescue animals have to give.
            It’s heartbreaking how many pets get passed over just because
            they’re not puppies, kittens, or the “perfect” breed. With Pawfect
            Match, I wanted to help change that by giving every animal a better
            chance to be seen and adopted, no matter their story.
