      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Pawfect Match is a web application developed by Jade and Olivia to
        support animal shelters by increasing adoption visibility for pets that
        have remained in care the longest. The platform is designed to
        prioritize these long-term residents, placing them at the forefront of
        the site to help them gain the attention they often lack. 
        <div></div>
        By focusing on
        overlooked animals, Pawfect Match aims to promote more compassionate and
        equitable adoptions. In addition to serving this mission, the project
        also functions as a practical application of full-stack web development,
        combining both design and functionality in support of a meaningful
        cause.
