      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Pawfect Match is a web application developed by Jade and Olivia to
        support animal shelters by increasing adoption visibility for pets that
        have remained in care the longest. The platform is designed to
        prioritize these long-term residents, placing them at the forefront of
        the site to help them gain the attention they often lack.
      </p>
      <p>
        By focusing on overlooked animals, Pawfect Match aims to promote more
        compassionate and equitable adoptions. In addition to serving this
        mission, the project also functions as a practical application of
        full-stack web development, combining both design and functionality in
        support of a meaningful cause.
